    "answer": "Sure, here’s a long one: A man is driving down the road when he breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, 'My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?' The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, and let him sleep in a spare room. That night, the man hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, 'We can't tell you. You're not a monk.' The man is disappointed but thanks them and goes on his way. Years later, the same thing happens—he breaks down by the same monastery, hears the same sound, asks again, and gets the same answer. Finally, after many years of wondering, he returns and says, 'I’ve been thinking about that sound for years. If I become a monk, will you tell me what it is?' The monks agree and put him through years of rigorous training and spiritual study. After completing everything, they finally say, 'Now that you're a monk, we can tell you.' They lead him down a long hallway, behind a heavy wooden door, down winding stairs, and behind another thick door. They open the final door, and he sees... Well, I can’t tell you. You’re not a monk."
